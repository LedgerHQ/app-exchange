| All types                 |
| ------------------------- |
| START_SIGNING_TRANSACTION |

#### Notes on COMMANDS:

- Command START_SIGNING_TRANSACTION requires that a UI review by the user has happened. \
    Either through a CHECK_X_AND_DISPLAY (legacy method), or through the dedicated PROMPT_UI_DISPLAY command. \
- It is always possible to restart the flow by sending a START_NEW_TRANSACTION command, except when the UI review screen is being displayed. \
- The command START_SIGNING_TRANSACTION will start the library application, the current application will not be EXCHANGE anymore.

### RATE_TYPE:

Different possible rates for the transaction. The rate is sent to the app as P1 of an APDU.

| Name     | Value | Description                                  |
| -------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------- |
| FIXED    | 0x00  | The rate in the transaction is a fixed value |
| FLOATING | 0x01  | The rate in the transaction is an estimation |


### TYPE:

Different exchange types are possible for the app. The type is sent to the app as the lowest 4 bits of the P2 byte of the APDU. \
Changing the subcommand after an exchange flow is started will result in an error response and the APDU is ignored.

| Name        | Value | Description                                                                                                       |
| ----------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SWAP_LEGACY | 0x00  | SWAP transaction (crypto against crypto) using legacy signature and encoding, deprecated by the NEW counterpart   |
| SELL_LEGACY | 0x01  | SELL transaction (crypto against fiat) using legacy signature and encoding, deprecated by the NEW counterpart     |
| FUND_LEGACY | 0x02  | FUND transaction (crypto to owned account) using legacy signature and encoding, deprecated by the NEW counterpart |
| SWAP_NEW    | 0x03  | SWAP transaction (crypto against crypto) using unified signature and encoding                                     |
| SELL_NEW    | 0x04  | SELL transaction (crypto against fiat) using unified signature and encoding                                       |
| FUND_NEW    | 0x05  | FUND transaction (crypto to owned account) using unified signature and encoding                                   |


### EXTENSION:

The extension is sent to the app as the upper 4 bits of the P2 byte of the APDU.

The maximum DATA in a single APDU is 255 bytes, in case it is not sufficient for a command,
it is possible to use the EXTENSION feature to send the command in several parts. \
To use the EXTENSION feature, craft the data of the command you want to send and split it in 255 bytes chunks. \
Then send this chunks to the app using a combination of P2_EXTEND and P2_MORE in each APDU header. \
The application will reconstruct the DATA by concatenating the received APDUs.

The application will refuse to reconstruct more than 512 bytes.

| Name      | Value     | Description                                                       |
| --------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| P2_NONE   | 0x00 << 4 | This APDU is self sufficient                                      |
| P2_EXTEND | 0x01 << 4 | This APDU is not whole, it extends a previously received one      |
| P2_MORE   | 0x02 << 4 | This APDU is not whole, the followup part while be received later |

#### CHECK_ASSET_IN_LEGACY_AND_DISPLAY
