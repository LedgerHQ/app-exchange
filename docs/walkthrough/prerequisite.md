Before proceeding with the SWAP integration, ensure that your application:

- Uses the [Standard Makefile](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-secure-sdk/blob/master/Makefile.standard_app).
- Follows the [Standard application format](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-secure-sdk/tree/master/lib_standard_app).

Although this step may seem unrelated to the SWAP feature, it significantly simplifies the integration process to the point that no support is provided if you do without.

If you need to port your application to the Standard format, you should use the [app-boilerplate](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-boilerplate/blob/master/Makefile) as example.
