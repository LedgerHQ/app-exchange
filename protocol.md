# Protocol to speak with EXCHANGE application

Communication is done through a series of request-response exchanges (APDU / RAPDU).


## Request:

| Bytes    | Description                          |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 1 byte   | CLASS (constant 0xE0)                |
| 1 byte   | COMMAND to run                       |
| 1 byte   | P1: RATE_TYPE of the transaction     |
| 1 byte   | P2: TYPE and EXTENSION               |
| 1 byte   | LC: Length of the data section       |
| LC bytes | DATA, content depends of the COMMAND |


### COMMAND:

| Name                         | Value | Description                                                                           |
| ---------------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET_VERSION                  | 0x02  | Get application version. This APDU can be sent independently of the current app state |
| START_NEW_TRANSACTION        | 0x03  | Start new EXCHANGE transaction. This APDU resets the app state                        |
| SET_PARTNER_KEY              | 0x04  | Set the credentials of the exchange partner                                           |
| CHECK_PARTNER                | 0x05  | Check that the credentials of the exchange partner are signed by the Ledger key       |
| PROCESS_TRANSACTION_RESPONSE | 0x06  | Receive the transaction proposal from the exchange partner                            |
| CHECK_TRANSACTION_SIGNATURE  | 0x07  | Check that the transaction proposal is signed by the exchange partner                 |
| CHECK_ASSET_IN_LEGACY        | 0x08  | Format the amounts and fees used. (FUND_LEGACY and SELL_LEGACY flows only)            |
| CHECK_ASSET_IN               | 0x0B  | Format the amounts and fees used. (FUND_NEW and SELL_NEW flows only)                  |

| CHECK_REFUND_ADDRESS         | 0x09  | Check that the refund address belongs to us (SWAP based flows only)                   |
| START_SIGNING_TRANSACTION    | 0x0A  | Start the library application responsible for the FROM signing                        |

The COMMANDS must be sent to the application in the correct order, this order depends of the TYPE chosen for the exchange flow:
1. START_NEW_TRANSACTION
2. SET_PARTNER_KEY
3. CHECK_PARTNER
4. PROCESS_TRANSACTION_RESPONSE
5. CHECK_TRANSACTION_SIGNATURE

- For SWAP based TYPES: \
6.1. CHECK_PAYOUT_ADDRESS \
6.2. CHECK_REFUND_ADDRESS 
- For FUND_LEGACY and SELL_LEGACY TYPES: \
6.1. CHECK_ASSET_IN_LEGACY
- For FUND_NEW and SELL_NEW TYPES: \
6.1. CHECK_ASSET_IN

7. START_SIGNING_TRANSACTION

#### Notes on COMMANDS:

- Commands CHECK_REFUND_ADDRESS, CHECK_ASSET_IN_LEGACY, and CHECK_ASSET_IN prompt an UI review screen. \
- It is always possible to restart the flow by sending a START_NEW_TRANSACTION command, except when an UI review screen is displayed. \
- The command START_SIGNING_TRANSACTION will start the library application, the current application will not be EXCHANGE anymore.

### RATE_TYPE:

Different possible rates for the transaction. The rate is sent to the app as P1 of an APDU.

| Name     | Value | Description                                  |
| -------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------- |
| FIXED    | 0x00  | The rate in the transaction is a fixed value |
| FLOATING | 0x01  | The rate in the transaction is an estimation |


### TYPE:

Different exchange types are possible for the app. The type is sent to the app as the lowest 4 bits of the P2 byte of the APDU. \
Changing the subcommand after an exchange flow is started will result in an error response and the APDU is ignored.

| Name        | Value | Description                                                                                                       |
| ----------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SWAP_LEGACY | 0x00  | SWAP transaction (crypto against crypto) using legacy signature and encoding, deprecated by the NEW counterpart   |
| SELL_LEGACY | 0x01  | SELL transaction (crypto against fiat) using legacy signature and encoding, deprecated by the NEW counterpart     |
| FUND_LEGACY | 0x02  | FUND transaction (crypto to owned account) using legacy signature and encoding, deprecated by the NEW counterpart |
| SWAP_NEW    | 0x03  | SWAP transaction (crypto against crypto) using unified signature and encoding                                     |
| SELL_NEW    | 0x04  | SELL transaction (crypto against fiat) using unified signature and encoding                                       |
| FUND_NEW    | 0x05  | FUND transaction (crypto to owned account) using unified signature and encoding                                   |


### EXTENSION:

This feature is only available in a PROCESS_TRANSACTION_RESPONSE command in a SWAP_NEW, SELL_NEW, or FUND_NEW flow.\
In Legacy flows the extension must be P2_NONE. \
The extension is sent to the app as the upper 4 bits of the P2 byte of the APDU.

The maximum DATA in a single APDU is 255 bytes, in case it is not sufficient for a command,
it is possible to use the EXTENSION feature to send the command in several parts. \
To use the EXTENSION feature, craft the data of the command you want to send and split it in 255 bytes chunks. \
Then send this chunks to the app using a combination of P2_EXTEND and P2_MORE in each APDU header. \
The application will reconstruct the DATA by concatenating the received APDUs.

The application will refuse to reconstruct more than 512 bytes.

| Name      | Value     | Description                                                       |
| --------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| P2_NONE   | 0x00 << 4 | This APDU is self sufficient                                      |
| P2_EXTEND | 0x01 << 4 | This APDU is not whole, it extends a previously received one      |
| P2_MORE   | 0x02 << 4 | This APDU is not whole, the followup part while be received later |

### Returned data

Only the COMMANDS described below return data. All others only return a code.

#### GET_VERSION

In case of success, this command will return the application version in format {MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH}.

#### START_NEW_TRANSACTION

In case of success, this command will return a nonce called "device transaction id" used for the initiated flow. \
